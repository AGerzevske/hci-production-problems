## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):
https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#usage https://material.io/design/layout/spacing-methods.html#
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
Get rid of lines from the background that are cluttering the visability of the process. I reduced some clutter from weird text like the AT above the donation. I reduced the side of the title so it would fit on one line and take up less space.



* HCI Guideline Two (URL):
https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html#
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
I used a menu icon to hide the diffrent menus: tickets, admissions, members, fifts and donate.
the top of the page is a menu area and could be colored, black, or grey and has the menu icon and the login and cart replaced with icons. Then the MCA title was put in the middle. The promo code field was removed.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
I used a hamburger icon, account icon, and cart icon in the top area.


I kept the basic style of the forms. I made one of the please select menus into just two raido buttons because thats all it was anyways. I added the hints to the forms for better clarity. The actual page should fit on one screen idealy, its just hard to sketch
