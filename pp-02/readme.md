## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text http://paletton.com/

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13x0u0kvm-UgAhroQqkHxQCPh+w
Your Rationale:
I based it off of playstation, meaning bright, strong blues. (if i based it off of xbox: strong greens or nintendo: strong reds)
snipped the image from this page https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/ps4/systems/
plunked it into an image analyzer tool http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/color-summarizer/?
and one of the stronger colors was #0F6CB2 	15 108 178
I used this for a baseline

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=55C0u0kh4qAbigjfflckItznjA1
Your Rationale:
Want light colors, likely pink, white, green, yellow, blue from flowers
based it off of a picture of flowers https://www.chicagobotanic.org/walk/april
got a pink color from the image alayzer #D26264 	210 98 100
whith the settings I had I got adjacent colors very close to the other colors the analyzer provided.
I feel that a spring time site would have the slightly muted, light, and colorful color pallet

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=3020W0kCPCPkQPeqBIv-+o5E7fG
Your Rationale:
I just went straight for bright primary colors. with the slider between light and darker varients of the colors.


4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=a3p090krqMhfbVdlvQXDBGqALp4
Your Rationale:
https://www.google.com/search?q=cybersecurity&client=ubuntu&hs=EOy&channel=fs&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirwfGFkufgAhXE24MKHd08A78Q_AUIDygC&biw=1853&bih=832
Cyan/light blue is the color you get just by googleing cybersecurity. red, black, and white will work for other colors as well. red works for the idea of insecure
I grabed an image and alalyzed it to get blue #25A8D3 	37 168 211

a light blue or cyan taken from the swatches, and the red varient would work.
the site would be based off of the black/white/blue and red would be used more selectivly
